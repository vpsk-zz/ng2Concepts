## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

## Create a new project based on the QuickStart

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/angular/quickstart  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> If the `typings` folder doesn't show up after `npm install` please install them manually with:

> `npm run typings -- install`

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.

### npm scripts

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `npm run tsc` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `npm run tsc:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
* `npm run lite` - runs the [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by
[John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and
[Christopher Martin](https://github.com/cgmartin)
with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.
* `npm run typings` - runs the typings tool.
* `npm run postinstall` - called by *npm* automatically *after* it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files this app requires.
Here are the test related scripts:
* `npm test` - compiles, runs and watches the karma unit tests
* `npm run e2e` - run protractor e2e tests, written in JavaScript (*e2e-spec.js)
